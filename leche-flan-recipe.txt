Leche Flan Recipe

Ingredients
10 pieces raw eggs
1 small can condensed milk
1 cup fresh milk (or evaporated milk)
1 cup granulated sugar
1 tsp vanilla extract

Instructions

Using all the eggs, separate the yolk from the egg white (only egg yolks will be used).

Place the egg yolks in a big bowl then beat them using a fork or an egg beater

Add the condensed milk and mix thoroughly

Pour-in the fresh milk and Vanilla. Mix well

Put the mold (llanera) on top of the stove and heat using low fire

Put-in the granulated sugar on the mold and mix thoroughly until the solid sugar turns into liquid (caramel) having a light brown color. Note: Sometimes it is hard to find a Llanera (Traditional flan mold) depending on your location. I find it more convenient to use individual Round Pans in making leche flan.

Spread the caramel (liquid sugar) evenly on the flat side of the mold

Wait for 5 minutes then pour the egg yolk and milk mixture on the mold

Cover the top of the mold using an Aluminum foil

Steam the mold with egg and milk mixture for 30 to 35 minutes.

After steaming, let the temperature cool down then refrigerate

Serve for dessert. Share and Enjoy!
